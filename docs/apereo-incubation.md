## Detail: Project status vis a vis exit criteria

(See [exit criteria][]).

### 4.1 Legal

#### 4.1.1 Out-bound licensing

uPortal-home and uPortal-app-framework include the Apache 2 license (approved for Apereo outbound) as LICENSE, but do not include the NOTICE file intended for inclusion with Apache2-licensed products.

Next actions:

+ Add `NOTICE` file. (Requires some auditing to get its contents correct). (Intended for Q3 2017).

#### 4.1.2 License marking

+ Partial but not verified-complete license marking.
+ Poor acknowledgement of dependency or inclusion licensing.

Next actions:

+ Clean up marking source code with license. (Intended for Q3 2017).
+ Automate source code header checking
+ Add NOTICE file. Audit inclusions and dependencies to get its contents right. (Intended for Q3 2017).
+ Automate `NOTICE` file checking

#### 4.1.3 Contributor License Agreements

Most major contributors have ICLAs on file.

Next actions:

+ Follow up with 1 remaining past Contributor to secure ICLA. (Intended for Q3 2017).
+ Potentially implement cla-assistant.io with the wrinkle of it asking contributors to attest to their compliance with the external-to-CLA-assistant CLA agreement process. (Click-through assurance that demonstrated CLA agreement through more arduous process, not click-through agreement to CLA.)

#### 4.1.4 Name trademark clarity

Naming considerations: Names should reflect uPortal commitment and represent how the product should be used.


+ Proposed names:
  + `uw-frame` → `uPortal-app-framework`
    + The uPortal App Framework will house common functionality to be leveraged
      by uPortal Apps.
    + Institutions can provide a custom `uPortal-app-framework-config`
    + Developers can create their own uPortal Apps drawing from common
      configuration, style and functionality.
  + `angularjs-portal` → `uPortal-home`
    + uPortal Home will be a standard uPortal App that handles layout of the
      framework widgets for a cohesive user experience.
    + Developers provide `uPortal-home-config` for environment specific
      configuration.

Next actions:

+ Implement repo re-naming in the course of migrating repos into a `uPortal-Project` GitHub organization. (Intended for Q3 2017).
+ Apply product re-naming in documentation
+ Apply product re-naming in source



### 4.2 Community

#### a. Level of community involvement

> What is the number of participants? What level of participation is there? What activities do participants undertake or what artifacts have they created?)


Next actions:

+ Open, public incubation status check-in conference calls. (Continuing in Q3 2017).
+ Move GitHub repositories to a uPortal-project context. (Intended for Q3 2017).

#### b. Organization of community

> What roles are in place? Who occupies those roles? How do those roles interact among one another and with the community?

Roles:

+ [Committers]
+ [Contributors]

Next actions

+ Document any roles not yet listed.
+ Document how the roles interact.

#### c. Operation of community

> What activities/events/artifacts are created/managed by the project to foster participation and development? How are decisions made?

+ [Committers][] are documented, with Apache-style governance by the Committers, process for adding Committers, and governance fail-safes.
+ [Contributors][] are gratefully acknowledged.
+ Pre-conference seminar and presentations about this project delivered at Open Apereo 2015, 2016, and 2017.
+ Incubation status calls are held as open conference calls.

### 4.3 Governance

+ [Committers][] are documented, with Apache-style governance by the Committers, process for adding Committers, and governance fail-safe falling back on uPortal steering.

Committers include a non-University-of-Wisconsin committer (Christian Murphy).

### 4.4 Voting practices

+ [Adopted Apache-style rules][Committers]

### 4.5 Conflict resolution policy

+ Inherits code of conduct considerations from uPortal which participates in the [Apereo Welcoming Policy][].

No formal conflict resolution policy is in place.

Next actions:

+ Adopt a conflict resolution policy (or inherit from uPortal)

### 4.6 Release planning

Releases come together organically. They're the changes from the accepted Pull Requests since the prior release, with Semantic Versioning observed.

Next actions:

+ Move product issue tracking into a public context. Currently product issue tracking to the extent it exists is implied from the Scrum stories on the MyUW product and sprint backlogs. Scrum stories and product issue tracker entries for bugs, features, etc. aren't the same thing.
+ Further document release planning, beyond just release execution.
+ Further document adoption of Semantic Versioning.
+ Start looking a few more milestones out
+ Consider adopting a predictable release cadence

### 4.7 Successful release during Incubation

uPortal-home has had many releases.

Let's say Incubation starts for this purpose after governance and licensing is squared and the repos are moved to a uPortal-project context. Successfully releasing after those changes are in place will demonstrate that the product can still release under the new arrangements.

Next actions:

+ Make the transition to a uPortal-project GitHub organization context, then, cut a release.

### 4.8 Alignment and synergy with other Apereo software products

Depends on and leverages uPortal.

Aspires to depend on and leverage more feasible microservices and hopes to evolve with uPortal itself in this direction.

Next actions:

+ Factor out app directory as a microservice
+ Factor out user layout as a microservice

### 4.9 Infrastructure

#### a. Version control

Using GitHub repositories.

Next actions:

+ Move GitHub repositories to a non-UW-Madison-specific organizational context. (Intended for Q3 2017).

#### b. Issue tracking

Intend to use GitHub issue tracking for product issue tracking.

Next actions:

+ Use GitHub issue tracking for product management in earnest. (This subset of) MyUW Scrum team user stories become references to public issue tracker issues.

#### c. Communications channels

Currently piggyback on uPortal email lists, only somewhat effectively.

Next actions:

+ Use Incubation check-in meetings, making these open meetings and drawing in would-be participants. (Continuing in Q3 2017).
+ Consider advocating for an Apereo Discourse instance and adopt Discourse forums in lieu of traditional email list.
+ Consider how to better fit into existing uPortal email lists, or create new lists.

#### d. Plans, directions, and objectives are readily identifiable

Long range plans don't so much exist.

Next actions:

+ Articulate product plans, directions, objectives
+ Navigate tension between product roadmapping and agile, organic discovery of product progress

#### e. Website: current and with instructions for installation, configuration

Both uPortal-home and uPortal-app-framework use GitHub Pages to generate documentation websites, including installation and configuration instructions. Documentation of the uPortal integration specifically is weak.

Next actions:

+ Improve documentation helping with, no seriously, how do I adopt this with a vanilla uPortal
