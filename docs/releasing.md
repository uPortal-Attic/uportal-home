# Releasing uPortal-home

## Apache release rules

This project has [adopted Apache rules][] with necessary or pragmatic local adaptations.

Release authorization, or the delegation of release authority to one or more release engineers, should be documented by [a suitable vote][Apache Release Policy re Release Approval] of [the uPortal-home Committers][] on [uportal-dev@][].

## Release steps

### Finalize documentation

Before cutting the release, review the [CHANGELOG][], and verify what kind of release is appropriate: major, minor, or patch (x.y.z respectively). (See [Semantic Versioning][].)

### Java release

Use the Maven command line client to prepare, build, sign, and publish to the
Sonatype-hosted central open source software artifact repository.

```sh
mvn release:prepare
mvn release:perform
```

_Iff it went well_, push the 2 new git commits to
uPortal-Project/uportal-home:master . Both of these commits were
generated by the mvn release commands. The first is the commit that set the
version numbers to the version you released; the second is the commit that set
the version numbers to the new snapshot.

Assuming that your `origin` is uPortal-project/uPortal-home, you can
push those commits using:

```sh
git push origin master
git push origin uportal-home-maven-<version> *
```
* Note: This command may result with errors. You may skip this step if a new tag has been created. Run `git tag -l` to verify.

If you call canonical something else (like, say, `upstream`), you'll need to
adjust the git push commands accordingly.

### Updating JIRA issues

UW-Madison uses a private JIRA instance tracking work on this project.
In practice committers serving as release engineers on uportal-home are
UW-Madison staff with access to this private JIRA.

In the [`MUMUP` JIRA project][], find the last unreleased patch version. If the
current release is a major or minor update, rename the version accordingly.
Apply that version as a `Fix Version` to the JIRA tickets resolved since the
last release. When all tickets have been added, `Release` the version and
create the next patch version.
