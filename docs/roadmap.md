## Accessibility

Working towards WCAG2:A compliance with confidence in remaining compliant.

Concretely this has meant or might soon mean:

+ Attention to focus order.
+ Enabling re-ordering home page content via keyboard controls.

Hoping to automate some accessibility checking to make accessibility progress
sustainable.

## Enable easier adoption

+ Internationalization
+ Easier build and deploy process
+ Update the technology stack
+ Update adoption documentation

## Development framework as Web Components

Vision: enable development of "uPortal application framework" applications
without constraining those applications' other technology choices. Use Angular
or Vue or React or Preact or whatever -- the
"uPortal-application-framework-ness" is happening at a different architectural
level via Web Components that you import and drop in.
