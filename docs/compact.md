Compact mode is a simple, minimalist interface for MyUW. This mode caters to small screens and users who want to see many widgets at once.

The compact widgets pictured above consist of the following:
+ Info icon (displayed on hover): Shows the app description for the selected widget
+ Delete icon (displayed on hover): Removes the widget from the user's layout
+ App icon: A large icon that represents the app's main purpose or function
+ Title: The title of the application (e.g. Email)
