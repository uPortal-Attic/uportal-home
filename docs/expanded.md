# Expanded mode

Expanded mode (also referred to as widget mode) is a new method of displaying important content to users about your application. Use it to display
the most important information, which can be user specific.

Several [widget types](widgets.md) are pictured in the image above. All of them demonstrate:

* Configurable title text (across the top of each tile)
* Configurable launch text (across the bottom of each tile)
* Info icon (displayed on hover): Shows the app description of the selected widget
* Delete icon (displayed on hover): Removes the widget from the user's layout

## uw-frame styles

Some of the CSS styles for widgets are located in the uw-frame project. You can read about those styles in frame's [widget.less file on Github](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DoIT/uw-frame/blob/master/uw-frame-components/css/buckyless/widget.less).
