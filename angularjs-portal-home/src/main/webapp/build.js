    //- "uglify": (default) uses UglifyJS to minify the code. Before version
    //2.2, the uglify version was a 1.3.x release. With r.js 2.2, it is now
    //a 2.x uglify release.
    //- "uglify2": in version 2.1.2+. Uses UglifyJS2. As of r.js 2.2, this
    //is just an alias for "uglify" now that 2.2 just uses uglify 2.x.
    //- "closure": uses Google's Closure Compiler in simple optimization
    //mode to minify the code. Only available if running the optimizer using
    //Java.
    //- "closure.keepLines": Same as closure option, but keeps line returns
    //in the minified files.
    //- "none": no minification will be done.

    //optimize setting is used to optimize the build bundles (the "modules"
    //section of the config) and any other JS file in the directory. However, if
    //the non-build bundle JS files will not be loaded after a build, you can
    //skip the optimization of those files, to speed up builds. Set this value
    //to true if you want to skip optimizing those other non-build bundle JS
    //files.

    //If the minifier specified in the "optimize" option supports generating
    //source maps for the minified code, then generate them. The source maps
    //generated only translate minified JS to non-minified JS, it does not do
    //anything magical for translating minified JS to transpiled source code.
    //Currently only optimize: "uglify2" is supported when running in node or
    //rhino, and if running in rhino, "closure" with a closure compiler jar

    //files in the directory will be minified, and this value is automatically
    //set to "all". For JS files to properly work after a minification, the
    //optimizer will parse for define() calls and insert any dependency arrays
    //that are missing. However, this can be a bit slow if there are many/larger
    //JS files. So this transport normalization is not done (automatically set

    //project optimization, but do not plan on dynamically loading non-build
    //bundle JS files later. In this case, the normalization just slows down
    //builds, so you can explicitly set this value to "skip".
