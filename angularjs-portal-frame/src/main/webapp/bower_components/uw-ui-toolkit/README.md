# UW UIToolkit

A web front-end toolkit based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for designing and developing modern, mobile-first websites for the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu).

## What is it?

This toolkit, developed by [University Marketing](http://umark.wisc.edu), sits on top of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), providing all its features and functionality, with UW-Madison's look and feel layered on top.

Here is a page with some [examples](http://staging-2.uc.wisc.edu/examples/).

## Who is it for?

This project is for employees at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who are designing and developing websites for official offices, programs and projects affiliated with the university. 

The templates and logo file provided here should be used in accordance with the University of Wisconsin–Madison [Branding and Visual Identity Guidelines](http://umark.wisc.edu/brand/). 

## A work in progress

We're releasing this project into the wild early. As we go, look for more examples, more layout and designs and more documentation.

And please [let us know what you think](mailto:webteam@uc.wisc.edu).
